# 🕹️ Asteroids

A beginner-friendly Python game project that recreates the classic **Asteroids** arcade experience using the `pygame` library and object-oriented programming.

It introduces multi-file Python project structure, demonstrates real-world use of classes and inheritance, and encourages modular thinking through hands-on gameplay mechanics.

Built to strengthen foundational programming concepts while having fun — without diving into complex game physics or math. Great for anyone learning Python who wants to write meaningful code and see it come to life on screen.

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- Creating and managing a multi-file Python project
- Designing classes and objects using object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Implementing inheritance and encapsulation for game entities
- Using `pygame` to handle rendering, input, and game loops
- Managing state with instance attributes and method interactions
- Handling collisions and simple physics-like behavior
- Organizing code with modular design and reusable components
- Reading keyboard input with `pygame.key.get_pressed()`
- Controlling game flow with conditions and loops

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame==2.6.1
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py # Requires Python 3.12 or higher

## 📍 Status

✅ Completed learning project — currently considered feature-complete for its intended educational scope.

🛠️ In the future, I may explore extending the project by adding features such as:
- A scoring system
- Multiple lives and respawning
- Explosion animations for asteroids
- Player acceleration mechanics
- Screen-wrapping for off-screen objects
- A background image
- Alternate weapon types
- Irregular asteroid shapes
- Triangular ship hitbox
- Power-ups like shields or speed boosts
- Droppable bombs or other special items

For now, the project serves as a solid portfolio piece showcasing fundamental Python and `pygame` skills.
